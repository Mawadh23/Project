# Project
Project Overview:

Text Classification for Yelp Reviews: This part involves building a model to classify Yelp reviews as positive or negative using logistic regression. This model helps businesses analyze customer feedback automatically.

Included Files:

	•	text_classification_notebook.ipynb: A notebook containing Python code for building, training, and evaluating a Yelp review classification model.

Dataset:

	•	Yelp Reviews Dataset at Kaggle (https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Filhamfp31%2Fyelp-review-dataset&data=05%7C02%7Cs444003014%40uqu.edu.sa%7C4834dbcd69824c5f5dfb08dceba7ca44%7C79a057fbb0d544dd8f900bf7151f5c3f%7C0%7C0%7C638644353090156827%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=w8IONlImjUt3NiWjEH%2BOvko4HRAeoNxLJ2c0jdaUN4M%3D&reserved=0.)

How to Use:

Running the Text Classification Code:

	•	The main code is provided in text_classification_notebook.ipynb. It can be run in any Jupyter Notebook environment, such as Google Colab or JupyterLab. This notebook includes text preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The code also allows you to test the model on real reviews.
